UNDER FITTING:
Both training and testing accuracy is low
MODEL IS BAISED

OVER FITTING:
training accuracy good but not testing 
HIGH VARIANCE

FIGHTING OVERFITTING:
HOW TO INCREASE ACCURACY?

1.GETTING MORE TRAINING DATA
2.REDUCING/INCREASING THE CAPACITY OF NETWORK...dec no of nodes and layers
3.ADDING WEIGHT REGULARIZATION
4.ADDING DROPOUT


TRAINING ACCURACY: Daily Quiz
VALIDATION ACCURACY: Check points
TESTING ACCURACY:Finals

OPTIMUM:
Point where validation accuracy is the best, teacher at the end of class , conducts a test ad judge it 

OPTIMIZATION: REFERS TO THE ADJUSTMENT OF A MODEL TO GET BEST PERFORMANCE ON THE TRAINING DATA

GENERALIZATION: REFERS TO HOW WELL THE MODEL WOULD PERFORM ON THE DATA IT HAS NEVER SEEN


validation and testing both data are unseen

DATA AUGMENTATION:


capacity:no of layers

firstly less no of layers , less nodes then gradually inc that
